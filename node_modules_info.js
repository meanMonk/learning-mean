/**
 *  Caching :
 *      Node-Cache :
 *      Memcached :
 *          - No data persistent will get lost if server restart or down.
 *          - No sync
 *          - does not support replication as well data structures.
 *      Redis : REmote DIctionary Server
 *          - In memory data structure & can be use as db as well as caching
 *          - Supports DS like string, hash, list, sets,
 *          - Data is persisted and also sync the data every 2 sec.
 *          - Can be replicated easily.
 *  EXPRESS : Node web application framework
 *      features : - creating api is easy
 *                 - high performance
 *                 - Http utility method / middleware
 *                 - view system supports 14+ templates engines
 *                 - there is cli to generate app quick easy.
 *             Routing :
 *                  ex. app.METHOD(PATH, HANDLER)  // METHOD : GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS, TRACE, HEAD, CONNECT
 *  MORGAN : It's logger which provide info different format // combined, dev, tiny, common, short.
 *  BODY-PARSER :
 *          - This uses to parse the body from request object
 *          - provide the following parser :
 *                  1. JASON, 2. RAW, 3. TEXT, 4. URL PARSER
 *  COOKIE-PARSER : Parses the cookie from header and add it to the req.cookies.
 *  HELMET : - It's use to surpass the header params from the request; like = x-powered-by.
 *  MONGOOSE : Just an driver to manage the database & we also have mongodb
 *  MOCHA :
 *         - Javascript test framework running on Node.js
 *         - Making asynchronous testing simple and fun
 *         - Mocha tests run serially and also user full for flexible reporting.
 *
 *  SINON :
 *         - Provide the function like Spies / Stub / mocks
 *              Spies : use to get the spies on function call like how many times function has called & args passed to it.
 *              Stub : just like spies and replace the function and use to prevent the call to external resources.
 *              Mock : Fake method with programmed behaviour & expectation.
 *
 *  CHAI : - It's an assertion library just like asserts in node.
 *         - provide the functions like asserts/should/expect.
 *
 *  PM2 : - This is production process manager with inbuilt load balancer for node.js
 *        - Keeps application alive forever
 *        - Reload the app without down time
 *        - Facilitate common system admin task.
 *        - It generates startup script and configure them
 *        - Save all your process list and restore them on restart.
 *        - also having multiple supporting module.
 *        1. pm2-webshell
 *        2. pm2-auto-pull
 *  CLUSTER :
 *          - Single instance of node run in single thread so to take advantages of multi-core we launch node process.
 *          - spawn using child process
 *          - supports two method of distributing connections.
 *              1 : RoundRobin = master process listen on port accept connection and distribute across the workers in rr fashion
 *              2 : MAster process create listen socket and send it to interested workers.
